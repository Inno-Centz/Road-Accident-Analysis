# Road-Accident-Analysis
In this project, I worked on a comprehensive dataset detailing road accidents. As a data analyst, I undertook the following steps to derive meaningful insights and present them in an accessible manner:

**Data Cleaning:**

Corrected inconsistencies and standardized data formats.
Removed duplicates and outliers to ensure data integrity.


**Data Analysis:**

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
Utilized pivot tables and various Excel functions to summarize and aggregate data.
Performed statistical analysis to identify key factors contributing to road accidents.

**Dashboard Creation:**

Designed an interactive dashboard using Excel to visualize findings.
Included charts and graphs such as bar charts, line graphs, and doughnut charts to present data.
Created slicers and filters to allow users to drill down into specific data points.


The resulting dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to easily interpret data and make data-driven decisions to improve road safety.
